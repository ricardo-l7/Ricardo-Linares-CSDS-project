Culminating Project for Career Semester Data Science Course. 

Career Semester Data Science is an online data science course coupled with a remote internship (12 weeks of
online lectures and nine weeks of a remote internship with an international company). During this program, I furthered my programming skills in python, learned the fundamentals of Data Science (data wrangling, data visualization, and exploratory data analysis), and got an introduction to topics in machine learning, such as regression, classification, clustering.

Please see the PDF document for my findings and interpretation and see the COX DATA file for my code.
